<p> 
    Carbon footprints are typically measured in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents, allowing to include other greenhouse gases additional to CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g., methane). <br>
    This is not something people are very familar with, so we just ask you to make your best estimate without looking up any information. We are interested in your perceptions. <br> 
    <br> 

    We will ask you to give your best estimation of <b>the size of the personal carbon footprint of a series of people with different lifestyles.</b>  
    <br>

    Since the international unit for measuring this is 'metric tons and kilos', we will ask you to <b>make your estimates in kg of CO<sub>2eq</sub> </b>. <br>
    1 metric ton CO<sub>2</sub> equals 1000 kg CO<sub>2</sub>. And 1000 kg equal 2205 pounds. <br> 
    <br>
    In the United Kingdom each person has on average a total carbon footprint of about 7200 kgs. This is an average and can differ widely between people based on their income and lifestyle.<br>
    <b>To give you a better idea of the unit CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: An average car emits about 1'000 kg CO<sub>2</sub> (2'205 pounds) for about every 2'500 miles driven. </b>
</p>
<p>

    Please note that the individual carbon footprints you will assess are <b>simplified</b>, based on only 6 behaviors, so they do not account for a person's entire carbon footprint.  <br>     

    Next you will see how the task will look like.<br> 
    Then we ask you to <b>estimate the carbon footprints of 16 persons with different lifestyles </b> .
