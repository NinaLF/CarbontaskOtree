        This is an example of what the trip diary on the next pages will look like. <br><br>

        For example, here the car starts at home. Then, they drive to work, stay there until 15:30, and drive back home. In the evening, their partner picks up the kids from school with the same electric car and returns home. At the end of the day the car is at home.
