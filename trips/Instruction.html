On the following pages, please create a trip diary of all the trips you typically took <b>with your electric vehicle</b> each day of the week <b>last year in August and September</b>. Trips taken with a different car should not be included in this diary. <br><br>
</div>

A trip is defined as driving your electric vehicle to a destination and parking it there for at least 30 minutes.

<br>For each day, please first indicate where you started the day with your electric vehicle (e.g., at home) and where you ended the day. If you did not take any trips on a particular day, please select "Home" as both the starting and ending location.
<br><br>
For each trip of the day, please provide the following information:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Destination: <b>Where you went</b></li>
    <li>Start Time: <b>When you started the trip</b></li>
    <li>Distance: <b>How many kilometers you drove</b></li>
    <li>Duration: <b>How long the trip took in minutes</b></li>

        Here is an example of what your trips for one day might look like: <br><br>
        You start your day at home. Then, you drive to work, stay there until 14:30, and drive back home. In the evening, you pick up your kids from school and return home.
