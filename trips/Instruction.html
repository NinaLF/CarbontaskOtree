    <h3>Instructions: How to fill in your car's driving diary</h3>
<br>
    <p>Please now again think about last year in August. On the next pages, write down all the trips made with your electric car each day of the week. This includes trips by you, your partner, children, friends, or anyone else using your electric car.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What Counts as a Trip?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A trip is driving your electric car to a place and parking it for at least 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Examples: Going to work, school, grocery store, or any other location, including returning home.</li>
                <li><b>Only include trips with your electric car.</b></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
