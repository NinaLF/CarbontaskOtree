    <h3>Instructions: Driving diary for your electric car</h3>
<br>
    <p>Please now again think about last year in August / September. On the next pages, write down all the trips made with your electric car each day of the week. This includes trips by you, your partner, children, friends, or <b>anyone using your electric car</b>.</p>
<strong>What Counts as a Trip?</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A trip is driving your electric car to a place and parking it for at least 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Examples: Going to work, school, grocery store, or any other location, including returning home.</li>
                <li><b><u>Only include trips with your electric car.</u></b></li>
            </ul>
