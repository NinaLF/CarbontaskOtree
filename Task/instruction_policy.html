    In the following pages, we will present you with a series of hypothetical policy packages. The policies are designed to foster the uptake of electric vehicles.
    An electric car operates exclusively on electricity, utilizing an electric motor instead of the conventional internal combustion engine found in typical cars.
    Your role is to evaluate different offers for electric vehicles and decide whether or not you would choose to buy each car.
    <b>Your task is to evaluate and express your support or non-support for each policy proposal.</b>

    Each policy package will consist of different combinations of the following attributes:

<div>
<ul style="text-align:left">
    <li><b>Carbon Tax on Gasoline:</b> This attribute represents the presence or absence of a <b>carbon tax on the emissions from gasoline</b>, which increases the fuel price. A carbon tax is a policy tool aimed at discouraging the use of fossil fuels and encouraging a shift towards cleaner energy sources. In this context, it reflects a policy tool to stimulate the transition from traditional gasoline powered vehicles to cleaner alternatives such as electric vehicles.</li>
    <br><li><b>Subsidies on Investment Costs:</b> This attribute indicates whether there are <b>government subsidies (tax credits)</b> provided to individuals who buy an electric vehicle. Subsidies on investment costs are designed to make electric vehicles more financially attractive and affordable for consumers, promoting the adoption of electric cars. However, it's important to note that these subsidies also mean that the allocated funds are not available for other projects.</li>
    <br><li><b>Climate Label:</b> This attribute describes whether the government plans to introduce a <b>voluntary or mandatory climate label on cars</b> (or no label). The climate label provides information about gasoline cars climate footprint compared to EVs and the other way round. A voluntary or mandatory climate label is a policy tool to enhance consumer awareness and transparency regarding the environmental impact of vehicle choices.</li>
    <br><li><b>Adopters in the Neighborhood:</b> To evaluate the potential impact of a policy package, it is crucial to understand the number of people affected by the policy. This attribute gives information about the <b>adoption of electric vehicles in your neighborhood <i>over the last year</i></b>. Please make your decisions under the assumption that the provided number of people has adopted an electric vehicle.</li>
